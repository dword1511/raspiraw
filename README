Contains a enhanced `rpi2dng'. This is a subset of:
  https://github.com/bablokb/raspiraw

This enhanced version generates DNG files that work with `darktable', have the
correct `AsShotNeutral' values (while balance), and do not contain the empty
thumbnail. It will also copy EXIF tags, so you do not have to run `exiftool'
manually.

However, due to limitations in `libTIFF', rationals are expressed with large
numerators and denominators, which will cause problems in some programs.
`tiffinfo' and `exiftool' can extract the information correctly.

Requires `libtiff5-dev' and `libexif-dev' to build. Does not need patched
`libTIFF' anymore.

NOTE: for IMX219 there might be serious lens color shading. Use `darktable`'s
color correction and mask system to get rid of it.
