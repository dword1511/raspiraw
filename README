Contains a enhanced `rpi2dng'. This is a subset of:
  https://github.com/bablokb/raspiraw

This enhanced version generates DNG files that work with `darktable', have the
correct `AsShotNeutral' values, and do not contain the empty thumbnail. It will
also copy EXIF tags, so you do not have to run `exiftool' separately. However,
due to limitations in `libTIFF', rationals are expressed with large numerators
and denominators, which will cause problems in some `exiv2'-based programs such
as `UFRaw'. `tiffinfo' and `exiftool' can extract the information correctly.

Black level is still missing. `darktable' may complain about missing camera
white balance (for some color temperatures).

Needs `libtiff5-dev', `libjpeg-dev' and `libexif-dev' to build. Does not need
patched `libTIFF' anymore.
